# PCHA-KRACH-Ranking
A Ranking system for the PCHA playoffs.

Teams in the Pacific Collegiate Hockey Association are taken into account. Only their records against each other are considered. This program may use the KRACH algorithm as defined here: http://www.elynah.com/tbrw/tbrw.cgi?2016/krach.shtml. As of now, it uses the RPI algorithm as defined in http://slack.net/~whelan/tbrw/2007/rpi.shtml.

As of Friday January 6, 2017, RPI is implemented, and can rank the league. This can be extended to any sports league with a linear order of games played (not necessarily in time order).
